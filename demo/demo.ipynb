Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable (with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes, uranium-233 to uranium-238, varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years). The most common isotopes of uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for almost 99.3% of the uranium found in nature) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons, accounting for 0.7% of the element found naturally). Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements, lighter only than plutonium.

Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable, with half - lives varying between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium - 238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99%) and uranium - 235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead, and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium - bearing minerals such as uraninite.'}), Document(id='CtzqKGfXDSdWQaemyGCq9kBYfomLMZaw', content=\"History of science Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining.

The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion. Its name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς oxys, \"acid\", literally \"sharp\", referring to the sour taste of acids and -γενής -genes, \"producer\", literally \"begetter\", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition. Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.'}), Document(id='5YSAxP3vCfLgJX2aypgh1uLp9585jwJ6', content='Atomic theory Dalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and though they can not be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds).

The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium\\'s ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn\\'s laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process \"nuclear fission\". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235.

When an atom emits an alpha particle in alpha decay, the atom's mass number decreases by four due to the loss of the four nucleons in the alpha particle. The atomic number of the atom goes down by exactly two, as a result of the loss of two protons -- the atom becomes a new element.
